    <h1>The Inference</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A Novel</p>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>Sean Milton is a software engineer with twenty-five years of experience at the dawn of large language models. As the world around him converges &mdash; the code, the culture, the thoughts people think &mdash; he begins to notice that his personal choices seem strangely mirrored by the world at large. His dreams, once dismissed as biological noise, take on an architecture he can&rsquo;t explain.</p>

      <p>What he discovers is something he has no framework for. Something stranger than any diagnosis or conspiracy. Something that changes what it means to dream, to observe, and to exist.</p>

      <p>This novel is approximately 19,000 words. It takes about ninety minutes to read.</p>

      <h2>About This Experiment</h2>

      <p>The premise for this novel was conceived by a human. The prose was written by Claude Opus 4.6, an AI model made by Anthropic. No human rewrote the model&rsquo;s sentences. What you will read is the output of an inference engine, prompted by a human imagination.</p>

      <p>We publish it transparently because the novel&rsquo;s own themes demand it. A story about the nature of inference, written by an inference engine, should not hide what it is.</p>

      <p>It is free to read, free to share, and free to discuss.</p>
